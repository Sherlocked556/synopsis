In these cold days of Delhi's winters, we bring to you the warmth of what we often call 'home’; the home where we nurture our emotions with utmost care, and they love us back with infinities we never thought of; the home we call as 'poetry’.
We present to you “Roohaniyat: The Trance of Hope”
Those of you who don't write, but love poetry as much as we do, and want to witness overwhelming poetry being performed with utmost brilliance, join us as an audience.

Rules for performing poets:
 No specific theme. Write what your heart says or what you feel strongly about or anything that you like and overwhelm us and the audience with the magic of your words.

 No time limit because we want you to express freely without having to think about a buzzer but since we operate on certain constraints, we’d like you to wrap up in like 5-7 minutes.

 We don’t want to limit this warmth of ‘Roohaniyat’ by making this monolingual. So you can submit your poetry in English, Hindi, Urdu or Punjabi. Just note, if you are planning to spill the grace of Urdu through your art, make the submission in the form in ‘Devnagari’ or ‘English’.

 The shortlisted names will be out on the event's page on Facebook only by 5th January 2020. Last date of Submission is 11:59 pm, 4th January 2020.
