Resolve, and thou art free. 
The best way to resolve is to debate, present your thoughts and make your presence felt in a gathering whose main aim is to determine whether corporations play a role in environmental preservation efforts in third world countries. Senatus, in Latin means resolution and this is why we have named the debating event as Senatus. It provides you the platform to showcase your views with a firm determination.
